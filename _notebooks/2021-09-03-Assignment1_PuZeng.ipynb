    "This a question that can be solved by a brute force method which means that it can be solved by checking whether the number meet the property that the sum of itself and revsersed number will only have odd digits. Below shows the brute force approach for this question.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Brute Force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need a helper function (is_reversible(input_number)) to identify whether the number is meeting the property or not which is the sum of itself and the reversed number only consists of odd digits. Within the helper function, if the number can be divided by 10, then the number immediately disqualified for be a reversible number. Then, we need to generate the sum of itself and the reversed number. To reverse the number, we can convert the number into a string to reverse it by using \\[::-1\\], lastly converting to integer again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we generate the sum, we can check the digits of the sum by extracting each digit of the number. If the digit is an even digit, then the number is disqualified. But if the digit is odd, we keep checking on the next digit. For a number is reversible, the number can successfully go through the while loop and return True at the end line of the function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we use this helper function inside the function for counting the number of reversible numbers within a range that user defined. The count function starts with generating a list of number that is within the user defined range. Next, we are going to use a for loop to loop through the list to check each number of the list by using the helper function. If it is a reversible number, we increase the count by 1. The count function lastly will return the count which tells us how many reversible numbers within the defined range.  \n"

    "We can see that the square root of the number is the number can help to divide the factors into two halves. In addition, you may also think what if the square root of number is not an integer. We will then use the nearest integer of the square root as the mirror line. Thus, we can generate a list of factors that are below the mirror number to check whether the input number can be divided by those factors. As long as we find a factor of that number besides 1 and itself, we will return False as the indication of that number is not a prime and the function that generates the sum of the primes will increment by 1 to move to the next number in the list.  \n",
